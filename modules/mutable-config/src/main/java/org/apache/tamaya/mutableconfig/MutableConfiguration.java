/**
 * This interface extends the Configuration interface hereby adding methods to change configuration entries.
 * Hereby not all configuration entries are necessarily mutable, since some entries may be read from non
 * mutable areas of configuration. Of course, it is always possible to addPropertyValue a mutable shadow layer on top of all
 * property sources to persist/control any changes applied. The exact management and storage persistence algorithm
 * should be transparent.
 *
 * As a consequence clients should first check, using the corresponding methods, if entries can be added/updated or
 * removed.
 *
 * This class should only used in a single threaded context, though all methods inherited from {@link Configuration}
 * must be thread-safe. Methods handling configuration changes are expected to be used in a single threaded environment
 * only. For multi-threaded us createObject a new instance of {@link MutableConfiguration} for each thread.

/**
 * Distributed Propertysource using a in-memory hazelcast cluster.
 * Created by atsticks on 03.11.16.
 *
 * Basically all kind of property entris can be stored. Additionally this property source allows
 * to pass additional getMeta-entries to control the TTL of the data in milliseconds. For illustration
 * the following mapProperties will store {@code my.entry} with a TLL of 20000 milliseconds (20 seconds) and
 * store {@code my.otherEntry} with infinite lifetime (as long as the cluster is alive):
 *
 * {@code
 *     my.entry=myvalue
 *     _my.entry.ttl=20000
 *     my.otherEntry=1234
 * }
 *
 * By default a new hazelcast instance is created, but it is also possible to reuse an existing
 * instance of pass a Hazelcast configuration instance.
